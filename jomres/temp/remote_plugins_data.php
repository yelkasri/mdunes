Allows you to put a search module that offers searching on availability, price range, features, property type, room type, guest numbers, stars, country, region and town in a sidebar or top bar. You'll need to create a new jomres asamodule module, set the task to 'ajax_search' and the arguments to '&ajs_plugin=ajax_search_composite'. You will then have a new option in the administrator -> portal area which allows you to enable\/disable different options. You can also 'pre filter' property uids and property types, so instead of searching all properties, you can tell the system to only return properties that fall into a group that you have already selected. To do that, you would add more arguments to the arguments field like so : '&ajs_plugin=ajax_search_composite&property_uids=1,3&ptypes=5' By default all options are enabled, you can disable them through the new button under 'Portal Functionality' titled 'Ajax search composite settings', or through the arguments list. \r\n\t\t\tIn v3.8 we added the option to prefilter countries and regions, so to prefilter the countries so that only regions in certain countries are shown you would do something like &prefilter_country_code=GB,FR which will only show regions in the UK and France. Similarly, you can prefilter regions like so : &prefilter_region=Avon which will only show towns in the county of Avon. Because Avon is in the UK, no other coutries will be shown.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tTo disable an option through the arguments list you can set the arguments like so : '&ajs_plugin=ajax_search_composite&by_stars=0' however be aware that if you have set an option via 'Ajax search composite settings' to No then setting 'by_stars' in the arguments list will have no effect. The full list of options are by_stars, by_price, by_features, by_country, by_region, by_town, by_roomtype, by_propertytype and by_guestnumber, by_date. If you're using a bootstrapped template you've got a choice of two templates to use, by setting the Modal option to Yes or No. With this set to No then all filter options will be viewable as buttons. If set to Yes then the title becomes clickable and the filter options can be seen in a modal popup. If you have html experience and are familiar with bootstrap then you can further customise this look\/feel by combining the elements you like from each template into one. \r\n\t\t\tIn v5.0 we added a new Multiselect template, plus the option to choose the template style through the arguments so you can set &template_style=buttons\/modals\/accordion\/multiselect to choose a different style. We also added a flag 'view_on_property_details', which you can set to 0 or 1. This allows you to enable\/disable the plugin on the property details page, which might be useful if you want one view of the module on most pages (e.g. horizontal) and another view in the property details (e.g. in a sidebar).\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t","lastupdate":"2016\/07\/25","min_jomres_ver":"9.8.8","manual_link":"http:\/\/www.jomres.net\/manual\/site-managers-guide\/15-core-plugins\/29-ajax-search-composite","change_log":"v6.0 changed the Return to Results button to use a link where we can pass a flag so that previous search results can be listed. v6.1 PHP7 related maintenance. v6.2 Improved search by town query to be suitable for larger installations. v6.3 new changes needed by 9.5.6. v6.4 Added support for Enhanced Property List Totals plugin. v6.5 Modified region prefiltering. 6.6 Jomres 9.7.4 related changes v6.7 Remaining globals cleanup and jr_gettext refactor related changes. v6.8 Notice level changes. v7.0 Fixed some notice level errors.","highlight":"","image":"http:\/\/www.jomres.net\/non-joomla\/plugin_list\/plugin_images\/ajax_search_composite.png","demo_url":"","price":"40"},"alternative_init":{"name":"alternative_init","version":5.7,"marketing":"Allows various plugins to call the Jomres framework without actually running Jomres itself.","description":"When Jomres starts it needs some information to be created before it will run.
